## Task Description

Implement the following open source components:

1. **Code of Conduct**: Define community behavior standards

3. **Issue Templates**: Standardized formats for bug reports and feature requests
4. **Pull Request Template**: Format for submitting code changes
5. **Funding Configuration**: Support options for the project
6. **Community Health Files**: Additional documentation for community engagement

## Implementation Details

### Code of Conduct

Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md that:
- Defines acceptable behavior standards
- Outlines enforcement procedures
