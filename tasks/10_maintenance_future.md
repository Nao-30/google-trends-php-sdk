# Maintenance and Future Considerations

This task involves planning for the long-term maintenance and future development of the Google Trends PHP SDK.

## Task Description

Develop the following maintenance and future planning components:

1. **Version Support Policy**: Define which versions will be supported and for how long
2. **Dependency Management Strategy**: Plan for managing dependencies over time
3. **Contribution Guidelines**: Establish how others can contribute
4. **Future Feature Planning**: Roadmap for future enhancements
5. **Community Support**: Plan for supporting users and addressing issues

## Implementation Details

### Version Support Policy

Establish a clear policy that defines:
- Which PHP versions will be supported (8.x)
- How long each SDK version will be maintained
- When security updates will be provided
- Deprecation timeline for features
- Migration assistance between versions

### Dependency Management Strategy

Create a strategy for managing dependencies:
- Regular auditing for security vulnerabilities
- Update schedule for dependencies
- Testing with new dependency versions
- Identifying alternative dependencies if needed
- Avoiding tight coupling to specific libraries

### Contribution Guidelines

Develop contribution guidelines that include:
- Code of conduct for contributors
- Pull request process
- Coding standards requirements
- Testing requirements for contributions
- Issue and feature request templates
- Recognition for contributors

### Future Feature Planning

Create a roadmap for future enhancements:
- API feature expansion
- Performance optimizations
- Additional framework integrations
- Enhanced error handling
- Advanced caching strategies
- Monitoring and logging improvements

### Community Support

Establish support infrastructure:
- Issue tracking procedures
- Response time expectations
- Documentation maintenance
- Community forum or discussion platform
- Support contact information
