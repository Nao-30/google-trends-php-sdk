## Current Status
The project has completed the initial setup phase and has progressed through the core implementation stage. The core interfaces, exception hierarchy, HTTP layer, configuration management, and main client class have been implemented, providing the foundation for the SDK's communication with the Google Trends API.

The next phase involves implementing the API endpoint resource classes, which will provide more advanced functionality for working with the Google Trends API.

## API References
The implementation should refer to the API specification files located in the `reffere-helpers/gtrends` directory:
- **paths.json**: Contains Swagger documentation for API endpoints, including parameters, request methods, and response structures
- **schemas.json**: Contains JSON schema definitions for request and response objects
- **openapi.json**: Contains OpenAPI specification overview

These files should be consulted when implementing the SDK components to ensure compatibility with the Google Trends CLI API. The schemas provide valuable information about the structure of the data expected by and received from the API.

## Next Steps
The next step is to implement the API endpoint resource classes as outlined in 06_api_endpoints.md. This will involve creating specific resource classes for each API endpoint to provide more advanced functionality.

## Implementation Order
We will follow this implementation order:
1. ~~Core interfaces~~ (COMPLETED)
2. ~~Exception hierarchy~~ (COMPLETED)
3. ~~HTTP layer~~ (COMPLETED)
4. ~~Configuration management~~ (COMPLETED)
5. ~~Main client class~~ (COMPLETED)
6. API endpoint implementations
7. Laravel integration
8. Testing infrastructure
9. Documentation and distribution preparation
10. Maintenance planning
11. Open source preparation

Each task is dependent on the previous ones, so we will implement them in sequence. However, some tasks like documentation and open source preparation can be worked on in parallel with implementation.

## Implementation Summary

This file contains a detailed summary of what has been implemented so far, referencing the PLAN.md file.

## Project Setup (PLAN.md, lines 19-124)

- **Basic Repository Structure**: Initialized Git repository and created the basic directory structure according to the plan.
- **Composer Configuration**: Created composer.json with required dependencies and PSR-4 autoloading setup.
- **Development Environment**: Set up basic development tools including PHPUnit, PHP_CodeSniffer, and PHPStan.
- **Documentation Files**: Created basic README.md, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG.md files.
- **CI/CD Setup**: Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration.

## Task Tracking (PLAN.md, lines 125-251)

- **Task Breakdown**: Created comprehensive task breakdown based on the architectural principles outlined in the plan.
- **Task Files**: Created individual task files for core interfaces and exception hierarchy implementation.
- **Progress Tracking**: Set up a system to track completed, in-progress, and pending tasks.
