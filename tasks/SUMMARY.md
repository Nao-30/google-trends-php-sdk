## Recent Updates

As of Current Date:
- Extended PHP version support to include PHP 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3
- Extended Laravel support to include versions 10, 11, and 12
- Updated CI workflow to test against all supported PHP/Laravel combinations
- Implemented compatibility matrix in CI workflow to exclude incompatible combinations
- Implemented comprehensive release automation with GitHub Actions (Task 12)
- Created complete CI/CD pipeline for testing, building, releasing, and publishing
- Developed utility scripts for version management, changelog generation, and release validation
- Set up security scanning and dependency monitoring

## Current Status

The SDK is now in a stable state with all functionality implemented, tests passing, and release automation in place. The integration with the gtrends CLI API is working properly, and the codebase follows consistent naming and architectural patterns.

The project supports a wide range of PHP versions (8.0-8.3) and Laravel versions (10-12) to maximize compatibility with different environments.

The project has progressed through all implementation phases:
1. Initial setup phase
2. Core implementation stage (interfaces, exceptions, HTTP layer, configuration, client, endpoints)
3. Integration phase (Laravel integration)
4. Testing infrastructure
5. Documentation and distribution preparation
6. Maintenance planning
7. Open source preparation
8. Release automation
9. Extended compatibility (PHP and Laravel versions)

## API References
The implementation should refer to the API specification files located in the `reffere-helpers/gtrends` directory:
- **paths.json**: Contains Swagger documentation for API endpoints, including parameters, request methods, and response structures
- **schemas.json**: Contains JSON schema definitions for request and response objects
- **openapi.json**: Contains OpenAPI specification overview

These files should be consulted when implementing the SDK components to ensure compatibility with the Google Trends CLI API. The schemas provide valuable information about the structure of the data expected by and received from the API.

## Next Steps
The project implementation is complete. Focus will shift to:
1. Creating an initial v1.0.0 release to verify the automation workflow
2. Community engagement
3. Maintenance and support
4. Future feature development as outlined in the roadmap

## Implementation Order
We will follow this implementation order:
1. ~~Core interfaces~~ (COMPLETED)
2. ~~Exception hierarchy~~ (COMPLETED)
3. ~~HTTP layer~~ (COMPLETED)
4. ~~Configuration management~~ (COMPLETED)
5. ~~Main client class~~ (COMPLETED)
6. ~~API endpoint implementations~~ (COMPLETED)
7. ~~Laravel integration~~ (COMPLETED)
8. ~~Testing infrastructure~~ (COMPLETED)
9. ~~Documentation and distribution preparation~~ (COMPLETED)
10. ~~Maintenance planning~~ (COMPLETED)
11. ~~Open source preparation~~ (COMPLETED)

Each task is dependent on the previous ones, so we will implement them in sequence. However, some tasks like documentation and open source preparation can be worked on in parallel with implementation.

## Implementation Summary

This file contains a detailed summary of what has been implemented so far, referencing the PLAN.md file.

## Project Setup (PLAN.md, lines 19-124)

- **Basic Repository Structure**: Initialized Git repository and created the basic directory structure according to the plan.
- **Composer Configuration**: Created composer.json with required dependencies and PSR-4 autoloading setup.
- **Development Environment**: Set up basic development tools including PHPUnit, PHP_CodeSniffer, and PHPStan.
- **Documentation Files**: Created basic README.md, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG.md files.
- **CI/CD Setup**: Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration.

## Task Tracking (PLAN.md, lines 125-251)
