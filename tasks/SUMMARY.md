# Project Summary

## Completed Tasks

### Project Setup
- [x] Initialized Git repository
- [x] Created basic directory structure according to PLAN.md
- [x] Created composer.json with appropriate dependencies
- [x] Created basic README.md with project overview
- [x] Created .gitignore file with standard PHP entries
- [x] Created task files for all implementation steps

### Task Organization
- [x] Created task_breakdown.md with detailed task list
- [x] Generated individual task files for each major component:
  - [x] 00_project_setup.md
  - [x] 01_core_interfaces.md
  - [x] 02_exception_hierarchy.md
  - [x] 03_http_layer.md
  - [x] 04_configuration_management.md
  - [x] 05_main_client_class.md
  - [x] 06_api_endpoints.md
  - [x] 07_laravel_integration.md
  - [x] 08_testing_implementation.md
  - [x] 09_documentation_distribution.md
  - [x] 10_maintenance_future.md
  - [x] 11_open_source_preparation.md

## Current Status
The project setup is complete. The composer.json file has been created with all necessary dependencies, the directory structure has been established, and task files have been generated for all implementation steps.

## API References
The implementation should refer to the API specification files located in the `reffere-helpers/gtrends` directory:
- **paths.json**: Contains Swagger documentation for API endpoints, including parameters, request methods, and response structures
- **schemas.json**: Contains JSON schema definitions for request and response objects
- **openapi.json**: Contains OpenAPI specification overview

These files should be consulted when implementing the SDK components to ensure compatibility with the Google Trends CLI API. The schemas provide valuable information about the structure of the data expected by and received from the API.

## Next Steps
The next step is to begin the core implementation by starting with the interface definitions as outlined in 01_core_interfaces.md. This will establish the foundation for the rest of the SDK implementation.

## Implementation Order
We will follow this implementation order:
1. Core interfaces
2. Exception hierarchy
3. HTTP layer
4. Configuration management
5. Main client class
6. API endpoint implementations
7. Laravel integration
8. Testing infrastructure
9. Documentation and distribution preparation
10. Maintenance planning
11. Open source preparation

Each task is dependent on the previous ones, so we will implement them in sequence. However, some tasks like documentation and open source preparation can be worked on in parallel with implementation.

## Implementation Summary

This file contains a detailed summary of what has been implemented so far, referencing the PLAN.md file.

## Project Setup (PLAN.md, lines 19-124)

- **Basic Repository Structure**: Initialized Git repository and created the basic directory structure according to the plan.
- **Composer Configuration**: Created composer.json with required dependencies and PSR-4 autoloading setup.
- **Development Environment**: Set up basic development tools including PHPUnit, PHP_CodeSniffer, and PHPStan.
- **Documentation Files**: Created basic README.md, LICENSE, and CHANGELOG.md files.
- **CI/CD Setup**: Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration.

## Task Tracking (PLAN.md, lines 125-251)

- **Task Breakdown**: Created comprehensive task breakdown based on the architectural principles outlined in the plan.
- **Task Files**: Created individual task files for core interfaces and exception hierarchy implementation.
- **Progress Tracking**: Set up a system to track completed, in-progress, and pending tasks.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed:
- Basic project structure setup
- Repository initialization
