## [2023-05-16] Task Breakdown
- Created task_breakdown.md with detailed tasks
- Created first task files:
  - 00_project_setup.md
  - 01_core_interfaces.md
  - 02_exception_hierarchy.md

## [2023-05-17] Project Setup Completion
- Completed composer.json with dependencies
- Created remaining task files:
  - 03_http_layer.md
  - 04_configuration_management.md
  - 05_main_client_class.md
  - 06_api_endpoints.md
  - 07_laravel_integration.md
  - 08_testing_implementation.md
  - 09_documentation_distribution.md
  - 10_maintenance_future.md
- Updated task_breakdown.md to reflect current status
- Updated SUMMARY.md with implementation plan
- Project setup phase is now complete

## [2023-05-18] Open Source Preparation Task Addition
- Added new task for open source preparation (11_open_source_preparation.md)
- Updated task_breakdown.md to include open source preparation
- Updated SUMMARY.md to reflect the addition
- Revised implementation order to include open source preparation

## [2023-05-19] API Reference Documentation
- Identified API reference files in `reffere-helpers/gtrends` directory:
  - paths.json: Swagger documentation for API endpoints
  - schemas.json: JSON schema definitions for request/response objects
  - openapi.json: OpenAPI specification overview
- Updated SUMMARY.md to include information about these reference files
- These files should be consulted during implementation to ensure API compatibility
- The API documentation will be particularly helpful for implementing the endpoints in task 06_api_endpoints.md

## [2023-05-20] Core Interfaces Implementation
- Created the following interfaces in src/Contracts/:
  - ClientInterface: Defines all methods for interacting with the API endpoints
  - ConfigurationInterface: Defines methods for configuration management
  - RequestBuilderInterface: Defines methods for building HTTP requests
  - ResponseHandlerInterface: Defines methods for handling API responses
- Each interface has comprehensive PHPDoc comments with parameter and return type information
- Used API documentation from reffere-helpers/gtrends to ensure proper method signatures
- Updated task_breakdown.md to mark interface definitions as completed
- Created a dedicated feature branch for core interfaces implementation

## [2023-05-21] Exception Hierarchy Implementation
- Created the following exception classes in src/Exceptions/:
  - GtrendsException: Base exception class for all SDK exceptions
  - ApiException: For API-related errors including HTTP errors
  - ConfigurationException: For configuration-related errors
  - NetworkException: For network connectivity issues
  - ValidationException: For parameter validation errors
- Each exception class extends from the base GtrendsException
- Added context information management to facilitate debugging
- Implemented specific properties and methods for each exception type
- All classes follow PSR-12 coding standards with comprehensive PHPDoc comments
- Created a dedicated feature branch (feature/exception-hierarchy) for this implementation
- Updated task_breakdown.md to mark exception hierarchy as completed

## Next Steps
- Proceed with HTTP layer implementation (03_http_layer.md)

## Pending Tasks
- HTTP layer implementation
- Configuration management implementation
- Main client class implementation
- API endpoint implementation
- Laravel integration
- Testing implementation
- Documentation and distribution preparation
- Maintenance planning
- Open source preparation
